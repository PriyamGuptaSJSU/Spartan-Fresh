        <h1>About Us </h1>
        <br>
        <p>Established in 2022, Spartan Fresh is San Jose State’s first grocery store on campus.
            We are located in the South of 9th street right across from San Jose State University Dorms.
        </p>
        <p>Whether convenient for people who live in dorms, it is a quick walking distance for people to grab food or a
            quick snack if they’re hungry. Students who do not live in dorms are also welcome and will be welcomed with
            many
            fresh foods around them.</p>
        <p>We have a variety of foods with many options such as fruits, vegetables, meat, desserts and so much more.
            We tend to have daily fresh shipping of fruits and vegetables each day to meet almost every student's needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Apples, bananas, carrots, strawberries, blueberries, and more to list are always fresh so students can
            safely
            guarantee they will get all the daily vitamins they need. These fruits are always freshly picked and brought
            to
            the grocery store on a daily basis. We have steak and meat available for purchase in the freezer for
            students that may
            want to cook.
        </p>
        <p>
            We value each student’s needs every year. We ensure that your time here will be saved efficiently and
            receive the best quality!
            Spartan Fresh has unbeatable prices as we do compare prices to your local grocery store. We also have a 10%
            discount off to students
            enrolled in SJSU only!
        </p>
        <p>
            Spartan Fresh does its best to keep things fresh each day. We want our students to always be healthy and
            strong.
        </p>
